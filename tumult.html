  <h1>Tumult of Aranjuez</h1>

<p>The Tumult of Aranjuez was an uprising led against King Charles IV that took place in the town of Aranjuez, Spain, on 17â€“19 March 1808. The event, which is celebrated annually in the first week of September, commemorates the fall of the monarch and the subsequent accession of his son Ferdinand VII. It is celebrated in September rather than in March as the revived celebrations in Aranjuez that began in 1988 were added on top of pre-existing September festivals.
